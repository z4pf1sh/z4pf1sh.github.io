# Hello

Congratulations, you have found The Depths, where a mysterious carbon-based life resides and occasionally produces some random information with random entropy.

<!-- more -->

OK, so, apparently, you would like to learn more. Here is some information you can refer to.

## Questions

### What should I expect?

Anything fancy enough to show the public.

### Are there some specific topics?

The Depths will be a place that is more technology-focused.

### When will there be any updates?

Like mentioned above, totally random.

### My question is not on the list! Will it be answered?

You bet. Since the whole site is hosted on GitHub Pages, feel free to open issues regarding your question, as long as you keep civil.
