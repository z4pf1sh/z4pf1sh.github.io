# Hello

Congratulations, you have found The Depths, where a mysterious carbon-based life resides and occasionally produces some random information with random entropy.

<!-- more -->

OK, so, apparently, you would like to learn more. Here is some information you can refer to.

## Questions

### What is the main language of the site?

Apparently English, idk what variant[^1] but English anyways. But do expect some posts in Simplified Chinese, feel free to ignore those you cannot read.

### What should I expect?

Anything fancy enough to show the public.

### Are there some specific topics?

The Depths will be a place that is more technology-focused.

### When will there be any updates?

Like mentioned above, totally random.

### Will there be ads?

No. I do not live off this site.

### What was this site built with?

See the footer, it is [mkdocs-material :octicons-link-external-16:](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Give it a star, it's awesome.

### Why did not you use alternatives like Hexo or Jekyll?

It has got complete features for blogging and advanced formatting. Plus, I personally find it ironic that Google themselves are no longer doing Material Design right. Heck, even Microsoft's latest Fluent Design is heavily inspired by Google. Just look at the hamburger menu!

If you miss the good old Material days, visit [m1.material.io :octicons-link-external-16:](https://m1.material.io/).

### Your site logo is ugly.

This is apparently not a question but thanks for not using worse words anyways.

### My question is not on the list! Will it be answered?

You bet. Since the whole site is hosted on GitHub Pages, feel free to open issues regarding your question, as long as you keep civil.

## Privacy Policy

In order to comply with regulations, a simple Privacy Policy was put together and posted here.
